 "recursion can be solve using 2 methods"
 # recursion can be easily visualized by ->> Euler's tree
                                         ->> recursion tree
                                         ->> calls in the stack
   // also have to check the value pass in variable as for every call new variables are created
   // return statement + base case  
1. Faith Expectation method
  ->> we meet expectation from establishing faith
  // mostly we do work in postorder
2. Level and its possible options
  ->> print the result in base case
  // all examples of recursion_onthewapup
